      "We flew with Germanwings (or tried to) on September 30th. After two lengthy delays passengers were notified that the flight was cancelled and to return to the check-in counter for further information. After waiting at the counter for another 30 minutes or so, staff began issuing refunds or providing alternate travel options to passengers. By this point it was quite late in the evening with limited options (plus we were 5+ hours after planned departure). We managed to get a voucher with 3 other passenger to get a flight from Stuttgart to Zurich with an ongoing connection to Amsterdam (flights were with Swiss). We made the flight and the connector (which was held back waiting for about 70 of us) however luggage did not make it. Short of this is the airline was ill-prepared to manage this. They offered little information or options to passengers. since returning home I have been attempting to contact them via email and phone calls to discuss compensation per passenger rights brochure and they have been unresponsive. Not a good way to run a business.\n",

      "I am less than impressed with Germanwings service to say the least. On my first connection to Hamburg the stewardess has told us that we could have some water for free, while everything has to be charged. During my second connection from Hamburg to London I was refused some water, despite being pregnant and not feeling well. I find this disgusting, the fact that a passenger will not be offered water if they're unwell, and will not be looked after in any way. Needless to say the stewards would only be nice to the passengers who have also booked their on board meals or bought on board drinks.\n",

      "Flew from Palma de Mallorca to Cologne with Germanwings. Check-in was done in less than 15 minutes, we got seats in row 6 which were fine. Planes were late as always due to incoming plane being late, that is a general problem with Germanwings when you fly later in the day. There was no entertainment whatsoever and the service crew were friendly but nothing more. They charge you EUR 2,50 for 250ml a soft drink like Coke or Sprite, so we paid EUR 5 for two cans, that make EUR 10 for a litre. Nothing else was offered, so nothing special. No miles were credited, even as a miles and more member.\n",

How is it possible that the ground staff makes an anouncement about late departure due to late arrival of an airplane 5 minutes before the official boarding time? Wherever the plane came from it should be possible that the pilot contacts the ground staff at the point of destination the minute they leave with delay and from that time onwards it should be possible to calculate very clearly when the plane should arrive.\n",

      "We were delayed 5 hours in Istanbul and received a sandwich on the plane as compensation. Told by the cabin crew that many planes were delayed due to technical problems that day so we would definitely catch our transit flight to London. Arrived Dusseldorf, no information given, transit closed. Eventually told to go to Lufthansa ticket desk where we joined a long queue for about 2 hours. Eventually told no flights tonight, maybe one on Monday (2days later). Lufthansa and Germanwings staff didn't seem to know who was doing what. Came back to ticket desk at 5am next morning and given overbooked standby ticket for 4 hours later. We made a fuss and insisted on getting a seat (otherwise we would have taken the train). We were given a seat but suspect that others were bumped down by Germanwings who were prioritising based on who made the biggest noise. Bad karma probably meant our flight took off but had to turn back to Dusseldorf due to more technical problems so we went round the same circle again - delay, no communication. This time we ran across the airport to the now familiar ticket desk where we were given tickets to London via Munich. Arrived home 39 hours after we left Istanbul, vowing never to book Germanwings again. Flight out with Turkish Airlines was a dream, should have booked return trip. Had to pay extra for Germanwings luggage which wasn't clear through Opodo the booking agent.\n",

      "Checked in at Dusseldorf for our Germanwings flight, and check in person asked whether we were a cancellation from yesterday. We said no, thinking it an odd question. Twenty minutes into the flight an apparent technical fault meant we had to turn back. Landed, but no bus to take us to the terminal for a good twenty minutes. Informed once inside that the flight was cancelled. Told to collect baggage and go to Lufthansa desk in departures. The queue there was enormous, approximately 60 people in front of us, and thirty behind. Waited for 3.5 hours in this queue. No explanations, no offers of help, no refreshments - nothing. Got to front and options left were either take a taxi to Cologne and flight to Stansted the same evening, or stay over till the next day. We are sitting in Cologne departures. The Manchester flight has a one hour delay and the Hamburg flight is cancelled. If we get out of here tonight it will be a miracle. Partner has already driven three hours to Heathrow, and now has a 300 mile round trip to collect us from Stansted.\n",

      "The flight was delayed by 6 hours, allegedly because of a radar system failure at Rome Fiumicino airport. Strangely, only the Germanwings flight to Berlin was affected, Air Berlin left on time. Delays can happen, but the complete lack of information and assistance was not acceptable. No ground staff was available, phone calls to Germanwings were not answered. No meal voucher was offered. To add insult to injury, access to Star Alliance lounges is denied to Gold members outside Germany when you travel with Germanwings because they are a Lufthansa subsidiary but not a member of Star Alliance. The flight itself was smooth, but no inflight entertainment whatsoever. For the same price, Air Berlin offers much better value. Will not travel Germanwings again.\n",

      "My wife and I were checking in our luggage for our flight from Hamburg to Geneva when a person who identified himself as the enforcer (his term) approached us and informed me that I had to also check in my carry-on. This was a surprise since it was below Germanwings allowable size. The enforcer instructed the ticket agent to weigh my carry-on. Unfortunately, it did exceed the 8kg weight limit. My only option was to remove excess weight, which I did. I removed clothing and gifts until I reached the 8 kg limit and placed them in the garbage pail provided by the ticket agent. I believe in following rules, but they need to be clearly indicated and consistently applied. This experience was in itself unpleasant. We checked in an extra piece of luggage and had to go to another agent to pay a 75 euro surcharge. However, we were informed that the surcharge would be 150 Euros for 2 pieces of luggage. The 2 agents communicated by phone and eventually discovered that we had erroneously been charged for an extra suitcase.\n",

If you want to get from A to B in a cost efficient manner it's an alternative. Flights would've left on time if it wouldn't have taken the flight attendants almost 10 minutes to get a passenger to finally stop talking on his cell phone thus delaying the safety instructions. The in-flight magazine is the worst I've ever seen. It's full of advertisements. Although I didn't order anything the prices for beverages and snacks seem to be the same as on other low cost carriers.\n",

      "Flew Best Class from Hamburg to Cologne. Best is not business but it is a best Germanwings has to offer. You sit in row 1 to 3 and the middle seat is free so there is maximum of 12 travellers. You have access to LH lounge which is full in Hamburg Airport. There is a choice of finger food salat nuts and gummibears as well as hot and cold drinks beer wine and spirits. Boarding with priority. Was a little surprised by the food you get on board you can choose from the Germanwings card whatever you want for free if it is loaded. The best thing was the flight attendant who was nice and very friendly. She addressed everybody by name and was professional. At Cologne it took ages again until baggage arrived so no priority for our bags. This was my first Best-Class with Germanwings would fly them in this class again but I do prefer LH instead if it is possible.\n",

      "Germanwings 9038 DUS-HAM May 6 yet another delay (and hopefully no cancellation to follow as it happens so often). The replacement of Lufthansa services that do not connect via Frankfurt or Munich with Germanwings has in my view turned out as a major downgrade. Aircraft layout (different seat pitch in economy in one and the same aircraft) and classes (no business class offering but instead a section labelled best) seem quite incoherent. Delays are frequent sometimes with subsequent cancellations without explanations from unwelcoming ground staff. Miles & More status is worth less than on LH (no fast lane no lounge). It is as close to a true low cost carrier as LH could get. Luckily there are some routes left where you get to choose (e.g. on HAM-ZRH Swiss operates some proper flights).\n",

      "LHR-STR-LHR. First time using GW and was quite impressed. Price was good (especially as it was from Heathrow). Plane was fine and as we had a Smart fare we got 32 inch leg room and a 23 kg bag which was excellent. Seats were the modern thin style which was OK for such a short flight but I'm not sure I'd like to do more than two hours. Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly which they probably needed to be on such a short flight. The smart fare also included a a drink and a snack and to be honest I wish they hadn't bothered because it was quite definitely the worst inflight meal I have had in over 40 years of flying. The snack consisted of a sandwich of turkey in soggy brown bread which was totally inedible a small bottle of water and a tiny Toblerone chocolate. I also made the mistake of having tea which was tepid dishwater. My tip would be to avoid the sandwich and have juice to drink. This was really a small disappointment in an otherwise excellent experience and I would have no qualms about recommending Germanwings.\n",

      "Flew at the end of October from London via Dusseldorf to Vienna. Both flights were on time. However I upgraded myself to a Smart fare. The legroom is decent however I wish I would benefit at Boarding. No Priority Boarding anywhere. I understand you pay for the Extra Legroom however I still believe we should board before other Economy passengers. The food is horrible. I did not touch it. I don't recommend it. The seats were ok and the crew could be a bit friendlier. Overall I would consider it again however some improvements to be done.\n",

      "Regular on HAM-BHX which is Germanwings operated by Eurowings Bombardier CRJ 900 jets. Flight has never been delayed by more than 20mins (>30 flights) and staff are friendly. I was able to get some very cheap tickets for this route so I cannot complain. My only gripe is the bus boarding and de-boarding at HAM. FlyBE connects to an airbridge both at BHX and HAM which is much preferable.\n",

      "Flight Stuttgart-Hamburg. Was regular user of LH flights since they put GW in place I do everything I can to avoid this airline. No value for money and cost are usually higher than alternative carriers. Other carriers offer way better service and value for money. I specifically dislike the fact that on the majority of the flights I have been using seats were broken (once you lean back they recline) and airplane interior was poor condition / not cleaned. On my last trip I advised the steward on board on a chewing gum sticking to the emergency exit seat and asked him to ensure it is being removed on the next cleaning cycle. The answer was that he was not cleaning the airplane. Think that shows the service mindset. Not up to what I was used to from LH I also experienced a large share of delayed flights.\n",

      "Cologne/Bonn to Manchester and return. Both legs of the journey were late. On both occasions we were called to the gate on time and then waited and waited. At least at Cologne Bonn there are seats and toilets at the gates in Manchester we were left standing for over an hour. No information from the airline and no apology - very poor show. Sadly this lack of customer service is my experience with Lufthansa short haul generally (GW are part of Lufthansa) which is why I avoid them for short haul flights these days. On short flights my priority is punctuality and here they are sadly lacking. A319 both ways which I find more comfortable than the 737s but that is the only positive thing I can find to say about the experience. Food and drink on board was pricey and not great quality - nowhere near as good value as Ryanair (never thought I'd write those words!). Next time we'll stick with Ryanair - the planes are less comfortable but that's not so significant when the flight only lasts 90 minutes and they are much more likely to get you to your destination on time!\n",

      "Flew London Heathrow - Cologne Bonn on Monday 8th September. Had checked in online and printed my boarding card 2 days before but as I had a suitcase to go in the hold I still needed to queue at the baggage drop-off point/check in desk. Flight left on time and was smooth throughout. The plane seemed new and was clean. My fare included a snack (choice of cheese or ham roll) a small packet with 3 boiled sweets (not quite sure why) and a small bottle of water. I chose the cheese sandwich which was ok but could be better. After the complimentary snack service the crew came round offering hot and cold drinks - including alcoholic drinks - although not sure if any of these were complimentary. We landed 1 hour after departure from Heathrow slightly less time than advertised. I have scored the in-flight entertainment a 1 purely because being a short flight there wasn't any and the website won't allow me to submit my review without a score. Based on my experience I would consider flying with German Wings again.\n",

      "I am writing this on behalf of my wife who is currently flying the wrong way across Europe due to the incompetence of this shambolic operation. She was booked to fly from Hanover to London Stansted. There was a short delay and the passengers got on. The passengers were then told to get off as astonishingly the crew needed to finish their shift. They were left waiting for three hours without any information. When they re-boarded the flight they were told they would be flying to Cologne instead of London to pick up more passengers. A bit like one of those cheap taxi buses I guess. Hopefully she'll make it home before I have to go to work tomorrow. Looking at the other reviews I would seriously think twice before booking with this outfit.\n",

      "Hamburg to Prague late Monday morning. This segment was part of a larger Lufthansa itinerary though clearly advertised as a 4U flight. The catch here is that Germanwings out of Hamburg is actually operated by Eurowings CRJ900s which is an absolute letdown compared to the usual A320s. The staff are enthusiastic about offering refreshments though - unlike Lufthansa proper - these are strictly for sale and are perhaps pushed too hard. There was nothing intrinsically wrong with the flight expect for the tight and cramped airplane these flights just don't measure up to the level of service across the LH network.\n",

Offered overnight accommodation at a hotel nearby. Told to come back for the next available flight to Berlin which was 24 hours later! After arguing at the ticket desk we were offered a morning flight to Stuttgart with onward transfer to Berlin. No word of apology. Luggage was lost at the airport and arrived 4 days later in Berlin after making numerous telephone calls and speaking to the Chief Executive of baggage handling company. Germanwings told us nothing and made no effort to contact us regarding the missing luggage or offer any form of compensation. Will never fly with this airline again.\n",

Cabin crew spend most time behind front galley curtains. Also fail to do proper cabin secure checks prior to landing. Seats new ultra thin models OK for short flights.

Arrived at the airport 1 hour early we were informed that the flight was delayed so we sat at the waiting area 15 meters away from the departing gate Tegel D75. There was no announcement for the Nuernberg flight and the next time we asked we were told the flight had already departed. Of course there was no Germanwing personnel to be found and we went to the Lufthansa/Germanwing service counter and were told the plane was boarding!

      "CGN-LIS booked long ago (05/2013) when their new fare scheme (Smart Best etc.) was not implemented yet thus I sat in seat 1F with generous legroom but got only a few points credited. But it was a good price and a generally acceptable standard as far as baggage allowance seat quality etc. is concerned. Flight left a little late no apology or reason given but with good tailwinds we made an on time arrival. Service on board was ok although the quality of their turkey salami sandwich is well below my standard it's just the fluffy British-American sandwich style not using the crispy rolls we like in Germany. On such longer flights of more than two hours they should offer a pasta or a similar hot dish as their parent company does on similar routes. Beverages were served as well - standard ones free of charge special ones or alcoholic drinks for a hefty price which is unacceptable to me (almost five Euros for a small bottle of wine (187 ml) in a plastic glass). No newspapers or other entertainment. Friendly and efficient service. I have to tell myself again and again: you get what you paid for - and that's what I did on this flight.\n",

      "I have now started realising what game Germanwings are playing with their paying customers. On three occasions now I have taken Germanwings return flights to Brussels. On every occasion the flight has been cancelled on the return journey to Stuttgart. This is because they do not have a full flight (around 50-100 passengers max) and therefore they make an excuse about a technical problem and shift passengers to the next scheduled flight which is also not full in order to send one flight to Stuttgart full of passengers but over three hours delayed. They are being greedy and looking after their profits and with no care for the passengers who need to get to their destinations or connecting flights. This is an absolute fraud and Germanwings are an insult to the passengers. Horrendous customer service always no manager to be found and just one or two ground staff passing on messages to frustrated passengers.\n",

      "We had bought Germanwings tickets from Helsinki to Berlin (and back) and departure should have been on December 6th 2013. However the flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions (other airlines were flying to Berling that day though). We didn't get any notification about cancellation by email sms or other means. At the airport there was nobody helping us to sort this out. Some ladies gave A4 prints with this kind of message to annoyed passengers: If you want to rebook your flight onto another date within the next seven days or you wish to receive a refund please refer to www.germanwings.com to cancel or change your booking without any additional cost. At the Lufthansa desk everybody was just raising their hands and telling us that they can't re-route us to Lufthansa flights because our tickets were bought from the Germanwings website. Instead they could have sold us new tickets for Lufthansa costing almost thousand euros per person! The next Germanwings flight wasn't leaving until the day after tomorrow so it wasn't any solution. So in the case of flight cancellation this company won't take you to the destination at its own cost as other airlines do.\n",

      "Flew from Birmingham to Berlin on 5 day winter break. Could not fault timeliness and having booked the smart price seating we were very impressed with leg room available. Plus the plane was very clean and gave a light and airy feeling. The food on offer was not very original with the same on offer outbound and inbound however people must remember that these are budget flights and for the money paid everything from check in through inflight was excellent. We would have no hesitation in using this company again and will be recommending them to friends and family.\n",

      "I am a regular customer of Germanwings and up until now have had no complaints. However a few weeks ago I was informed that my flights to and from London Stansted to Cologne from 10/12 to 18/12 had been changed to the evening flight due to what they called operative reasons. I'm sure it was over-booking. I was extremely angry. I had booked my flight well in advance and was forced to pay a £5 fine to change my coach trip from London to Stansted and back. If it happens one more time I shall never use the airline again.\n",

Ground staff were pleasant (was allowed to take extra bag without charge) boarding was fast and professional onboard the stewardesses were poorly trained in people management almost rude to passengers no interest whatsoever only talking amongst themselves. Upon leaving the plane she said goodbye whilst looking completely uninterested the other way! I did not feel welcome at all onboard. Captain was informative and nice we had to do a Go Around no problem all went well. We landed on time. All in all very disappointed with onboard flight attendants.\n",

      "Flew return from Heathrow to Koln on the 15th and 17th October and both flights left a very good impression. On the flight out of Heathrow the ground staff advised about a 10/15 minute delay due to the late arrival of the inbound flight once seated the captain advised that he would make up time and we would still be able to arrive on time which we did so all was good. The inflight service was good and efficient as one would expect from a German based company. The seats in the Smart section were comfortable and had plenty of leg room. The ground staff in the UK were efficient however one of the check staff in Koln was rather much too strict in not letting us check in at her desk even though we were the only ones checking in at the time. As seasoned long haul travellers overall Germanwings as a low cost carrier have left a very good impression on my 2 colleagues and myself and I am sure that we will use and recommend this carrier again and again.\n",

      "Flight from Vienna to Cologne - VIE-CGN - on the standard A319 airbus. Using the smart price class (level) my wife and myself had comfortable seats and legroom for this trip of 1h10min. The snack box offered and its contents are just poor the only reason for paying the surcharge called smart price is preselected seating and one piece of checked in luggage. The general quality of service is acceptable - friendly crew efficient service clean planes plus the feeling of safety/security you buy in a plane of the Lufthansa group. But do not forget: it is still a low cost flight - as a long time Lufthansa frequent traveller I will never get accustomed to the fact that they try to charge £4.90 for a wine. No passenger bought any alcoholic beverage.\n",

      "CGN to FAO Cologne to Faro on an A320. Outbound flight a little late due to late arrival of aircraft. Flight was on a jetway but passengers had to use the stairs. Crew were nice and flight was full same on return flight from Faro. I had a smart price ticket so you should sit in row 4 to 14 with more legroom onward flight I was seated row 15 return row 23. As miles and more member in my profile they knew that I needed a lactose free meal but you only get a snack box (cheese sandwich/roll or chicken/salami sandwich/roll) but both are not with butter/margarine they all contain cream cheese as basic spread so I was not able to eat that. When the crew came around I was entitled to only one soft drink you have to pay for wine or a beer. Spirits not available at all. Since both flights were full and only 3 crew members were on board it was a hard job for them. They have less toilets compared to the old LH planes so we had only 2 toilets for almost 150 passengers on the return flight one WC was not serviceable.\n",

      "Outbound the passengers were sent to gate clear we were considerably delayed but no information shared. Onboard the Captain informed us the cabin crew arrived late due to local motorway problems. However passengers had made it! The snacks offered were poor value for money. The crew disinterested. Return flight (my fault) I'd not included cabin baggage. The staff's manner of relaying this information was mocking and dismissive. The only positive is that the flight cost is reasonable. I'd avoid this airline if you want to be treated with respect.\n",

First leg was late over 40 minutes with no explanation done when the gate crew announced a 2nd delay of another 15-20 minutes due tyres had to be changed the gate was open to board. Take off was just after boarding so there was no tyre change. So no more Snacks and Drinks unless you pay for it. Bought muffin and coffee quality ok but you pay.

      "29th July 2013. London Heathrow to Cologne flight 4U461. I checked in online for the flight as instructed on their website and then went to the airport bag drop. The queue was very long and only one lady was in charge of the entire queue. She understandably looked stressed. Flight was on an A319 and the seats were comfortable enough for a short trip. A snack was offered for sale as this airline is a Budget airline but one which allows for through baggage. I picked this airline for my trip down to Italy partly based on price and partly based on the reputation of being the best of the lower price airlines. The captain was informative and the crew seemed to be pleasant and very well turned out indeed. During quite bad turbulence not enough was done to calm the fears of passengers. Arrival into Cologne was a pleasure and the modern and friendly airport made for a good stop over on my way to Italy. I shall report my next flight in more detail in a separate report.\n",

      "29th July 2013 Flight 4U838 from Cologne to Bologna. Flight was the second of two that day with the same airline. Flight delayed 1 hour due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. Staff kept the passengers informed in a polite and professional manner. Boarding was orderly and sensibly managed. The cabin crew warmly welcomed the passengers. The flight had severe turbulence and the crew did little to allay the fears of passengers. The lady Pilot made a few semi-audible announcements and did seemed to be focused on making up for the delay. Disembarkation was chaotic as Italian passengers pushed to exit the flight. The cabin crew did nothing to try and control what could have been a dangerous situation. The fare was not the cheapest of fares on offer and due to the abrupt manner of the cabin crew on this flight my experience of Germanwings has been soured somewhat. I won't use Germanwings on this route again.\n",

It's peculiar as a low-cost airline as it offers connecting flights though prices average double compared to the cheapest point to point options. The space for legs on a Standard A319 is the best I've found in the last 6 years of low- cost travelling. Personnel look professional throughout. Onboard prices quite competitive for euro nationals. I will definitely fly with them if I need to go to Germany in future.\n",

Most web check-ins had been deleted and boarding cards had to be reassigned at the gate. Horrible seating. Inbound flight was 70 minutes late due to 'problems all day long' as the captain mentioned.

This took an hour both ways on my round-trip from HAM-VIE. With LH or another Star Alliance partner this takes less than 10 minutes especially for FTL or GOLD. There was an error on my ticket. Ticket counter could not help but kept the ticket and I could not use the check- machine for reprinting the ticket. Again 40 minutes waiting at check-in. Check-in opens 2 hours before departure in VIE. Check-in is located so far away from LH you won't believe it. Germanwings is departing from Gates where there are no Lounges. No priority check-in at VIE airport either. As FTL you have privileges when booking and choosing the seat. Reservations from row 1 are possible. The check-in procedure and amenities are awful. Next time I will choose a star alliance partner for sure.\n",

You can check in on line 72 hours before travelling and can select seats free of charge.

First flight was good with an on time departure reasonably friendly cabin crew staff and a decent and comfortable journey. However from our stop in Koln/Bonn the trip deteriorated. We were segregated into a small area of the airport with very little to do see or even eat/shop. The second flight was 45 minutes late and had some of the most miserable cabin staff I have ever experienced. I wasn't even offer a drink to purchase.

      "CGN-TXL A319. Evening service after Cologne Carnival parade. Lots of passengers and even captain disguised accordingly. Boarding delayed due to late arrival from previous flight but crew managed to catch up: departure on time arrival 10 min early. Crew quite neutral whereas Captain made funny announcements in view of the carnival. Seat comfort is okay for such a short hop. Only buy-on-board program with relatively high pricing compared to quantity of products - so I opted for nothing. Germanwings is low cost and you practically pay for everything you want extra besides the seat. Germanwings has taken over complete service from Lufthansa on that particular route. Being Star Alliance Silver/FTL at Lufthansa means nothing if you fly on Germanwings (a 100% Lufthansa subsidiary). Some weeks ago in 2012 when LH still served the sector FTLs were allowed to use the LH business lounge. Now they offer you lounge access for an insignificant fee of 25  - what a joke!\n",

      "Flew to Cologne from LHR - return flight had to be diverted back to Cologne due to technical difficulties - over 2 hours after the original departure time we were told to embark after which having endured a 15 minute wait on an unmanned bus in minus 6 degrees we were told the replacement flight was delayed for catering to be loaded. Eventually left 3 hrs 15 mins late. Promised complaint forms never materialised. Will avoid this airline in future at all costs and at £327 for 2 hardly a budget price.\n",

      "STN-CGN. Delayed 30 minutes with no reason or apology given. Flight completely full with boarding well organised if somewhat slow. Due to high load locker space at premium so some passengers ended up sitting with big trolley bags under the aisle seat blocking the other passengers' exit. This went unnoticed and/or challenged by the cabin crew. Leg room poor towards the rear seats reasonable comfortable. Crew not very polite at all impossible to get smile out of them but reasonable efficient. Didn't buy anything from their menu prices seamed reasonable. The only reason I would recommend Germanwings is if the ticket is cheap and due to the fact you can collect miles for LH Miles and More programme.\n",

      "On a recent trip from Stuttgart to Stansted I had the window seat in a row which was also occupied by a young mother and her four or five year old daughter. The minor took the seat next to me. Once we had achieved cruising altitude the mother produced an iPad from her bag and placed it on the table in front of the child. Then without the slightest consideration for their fellow passengers a Mickey Mouse movie was run with the soundtrack coming to all in earshot over the speakers. Since it was a reasonably short flight I plugged my own headphones in a did my best to ignore the cartoon. Now that such technology is available I think it might be high time for Germanwings to regulate such behavior. Obviously a sense of social responsibility is no longer sufficient. Germanwings usually provides a decent service it would be a shame if they allow selfishly ignorant passengers to spoil it.\n",

      "On the booking confirmation form downloaded from the Internet it states that it contains all the information about the flight. Except it doesn't tell you which terminal the flight leaves from or that they operate an online check-in service. This resulted in me going to terminal 5 along with a group of Germans (flying with another airline) being delayed for check in (at terminal 1) and eventually missing the flight. My own fault for not being obnoxious enough to push to the front of the queue. I then need to cancel my return flight and try to contact the call centre to get some assistance but all calls to the UK number are barred.\n",

However if you are a LH Senator none of your privileges are available at London Airport if flying to Köln so was refused admittance to the Star Alliance Gold lounge in T1. Flight itself was chaos due to ground handling errors and late final figures but the in-flight service was OK if basic.

Return journey delayed by 1hr due to Birds in engine took off 1.5hrs late however we were last to board plane and advised that all of the overhead luggage compartments were full. One of our bags was placed with the other main luggage. Once the bag had been taken we realised our passports were in this bag and advised the crew. They told us that our bag would be given to us when we left the plane. Upon further enquiry we found out that our hand luggage would turn up in baggage collection. So a wonderful arrival at Stansted with no passports - kindly escorted to baggage collection to await hand luggage with passports - rather embarrassing. Anyhow just a warning that crew don't seem to be aware. Other than that a pleasant flight.\n",

      "EDI-CGN and CGN-MUC. I have always rated them as one of the best low cost airlines especially now that they allocate seats. However they don't have their own staff an EDI and the handling company can be hit or miss. There is no bag drop so even if you've checked in online you're still going have to join the regular queue. Having checked in on line and eventually dropped our bags my wife and I were sitting in our allocated seats onboard - 10E and F when another passenger appeared with a boarding pass for seat 10F. After a few minutes a stewardess arrived with a computer printout showing us in seats 15A and B. Since these weren't extra leg-room seats for which we'd paid we flatly refused to move. Eventually the stewardess backed down and the other passenger was seated elsewhere. The flight itself was fine and the 'Happy Picnic' was tasty and good value. Travelling on from CGN to MUC a few days later we checked in by machine at the airport and dropped our luggage at the fast bag drop which really was fast. The whole process lasted under 5 mins. Again the flight was fine although air traffic restrictions led to a delay of about 25 mins.\n",

      "Cologne to Palma Mallorca return. First leg delayed more than one hour no explanation or apology. No food or drink if not paid for. Seats narrow and do not have any comfort. Return flight was Germanwings as well but plane was from TUI Fly with nice legroom but they need to adjust the Germanwings service so no food or drink was served. Normally try to avoid flying them but this was a package tour and had no choice.\n",

      "Cologne-Zadar-Cologne. Check in at Cologne was swift and efficient. A319 clean and looked pretty new. Legroom is bigger than Lufthansa. Cabin crew was friendly. As we did not booked the lowest airfare we received a simple but tasty sandwich and drinks. Inbound flight a 737-800 apparently on lease from Hapag LLoyd. Legroom much more restricted and the plane was fully booked. Cabin crew from TUI. Service and friendliness was good.\n",

      "Great low cost airline. Flew Germanwings recently from Cologne to Prague. Very friendly and efficient. There are rules about baggage check in food etc. but if followed a good option for low cost travel in Europe and there should be no hassles. Most importantly felt very safe.\n",

      "PRG-CGN-PRG. Check-in at PRG okay. Onboard you have to pay for food or beverages (2-3 EUR for one piece) but for this short trip (55 ins)I think it is not necessary. Nice clean cabin the problem is poor leg-room but for a short flight it is possible to survive. A319 on both ways almost full. The return flight was not so easy - at the moment we were boarding they told us to stop because of a technical problem and passengers had to move back out of the bus up to the terminal building where we had to wait next 3 hours till the problem was sorted out - after 1 hour of the waiting time they provided vouchers for refreshment (5 EUR to spend in kiosks around the terminal). Generally it was well organised. I was fortunately flexible and not in hurry to arrive at Prague on time. We were delayed for more than 3 hours with our departure.\n",

      "Travel with Caution. If you need to complain about their service the call charge is 25 pence per minute. I purchased a higher priced ticket for London to Stuttgart which included for one luggage both ways an on-board snacks. In London they accepted my luggage without any additional charge but had to pay for all food and drinks. On return from Stuttgart I had to pay for my luggage and snacks. It is realistic to complain because it would cost 25 pence per minute. How do one get a response from German Wings?\n",

      "On two occasions had a very unpleasant experience with Germanwings. The first time they canceled the flight with reference to weather - however when I checked the website of the arrival airport everyone else was flying save for Germanwings. They merely referred to the decision of their company. We had to return back to Strasbourg and wait for two days for the next flight on which they were able to assign us. I had a small baby with me and the new flight they offered was not even a direct flight. On the second occasion the flight was delayed for more than three hours. However until the very last moment the passengers were lied to about the delay. Any attempts to obtain information and to be provided with vouchers for food were left without response. The call center in Germany tried to hide information about the delay saying that the flight was delayed for less than two hours. While the website of the airport already showed that the delay was over three hours. The company's representative was nowhere to be found in the airport. The Germanwings call center gave numbers of the airport service which in its turn gave numbers of the Germandwings.\n",

      "Found the customer service centre staff awful. They failed to mention that there is an EUR 80 fee when using the call centre. When I called back to query this I was told to 'take it or leave it' and hung up on. When I complained they denied everything and closed the complaint. To date I have not heard from them again. From previous experience the airline itself is great but the customer service and general attitude is more than bad it is insulting. Germanwings problem is not what it does but how it handles the ensuing complaints. Germanwings made me a very unhappy customer.\n",

      "CGN-ZRH. Despite the sudden snowfall at their Cologne hub Germanwings managed to keep their operations moving reasonably efficiently. Waiting PAX were kept informed and when the delayed aircraft came in from Leipzig it was turned around in less than 15 minutes. The aircraft seemed almost new and was less than half full. Service pleasant of the low cost variety and snacks and drinks cost no more than they would in a Cologne café. Germanwings has recently offered Miles & More redemptions making it a potentially interesting partner.\n",

      "We had to postpone our flights due to illness. Called the airline (GBP0.25 per minute) was told I could not cancel but only postpone and that I needed to provide a new date (c EUR25 per route per person). I decided to call back with the dates but also noticed a further EUR80 charge. Called a second time queried this with operator and was told 'take it or leave it'. I informed the operator this was unacceptable language and was cut off! Called a third time asked for the manager put on hold then spoke with the manager. Was told the charge applied to call centre fees and did not apply to online changes. As I could not get online I asked the manger to make the changes without the charge which they did. I asked for the second call to be investigated which they have not done. Germanwings are fine if you do not have any exceptions otherwise you might as well fly BA - at least they are not so extremely rude and offensive.\n",

      "Cologne-Zurich-Cologne used online-checkin on first leg so we only needed the drop off bags at check in counter. Seats have limited legroom but OK. Newsmagazin (Focus) was for free. They charge EUR 10/piece if you need to check in baggage but we paid by booking. Return flight check in counter was opened 30 minutes late but they ask you to be there 2h in advance if you have bags. No frill so nothing served unless you pay as usually on low-cost. Would prefer TUIfly instead.\n",

      "DUB to CGN first time flying with GermanWings. Friendly efficient (and thus precisely punctual). GW allowed us to pool our 20kg/person checked-baggage limit across the five passengers on the reservation so we didn't have to scramble to get one of the bags down from 22 to 20 kg. I also like that you can pay 20 in advance for a bag up to 30kg rather than get burned at the airport like Ryanair. Seat pitch a bit cramped but that's standard for budget flights; it wasn't a long flight so I wasn't uncomfortable. Didn't seem possible fully to match the better bargains on Easyjet or Aer Lingus but price was still very good. Tip: Join My German Wings before you book a flight or else as one post noted you can't check or change your booking on line.\n",

As soon as one tries to get into the bonus account the answer from the system comes with a long delay. The longer the more advanced one is in the actual booking. At the end one always gets a FEHLER on the page. I have tried plenty of times at different occasions from different computers running different OS and browsers. Always the same effect. The support phone number is also dead as expected even if they warn about .99Euro per minute.\n",

I wonder whether Germanwings uses special aircraft (the old one) with less seats on these long routes. Outbound delayed by one hour. Return on time but had to wait 45 minutes for the bags. Polite crew and nice flight. Had reserved 9 months in advance so flight fare was acceptable but still far away from the discount prices advertised everywhere. Rating would have been better without delay (almost impossible with Germanwings).\n",

      "STN-CGN-STN. Looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with this favourite budget carrier after a gap of 3-4 years my spirits sank on arrival at Stansted as a throng of passengers for both this and the similarly-timed Stuttgart flight were milling around the check-in desk. Only one person was dealing with the two flights. This was down to the Swissport agency. A manageress from the latter belatedly assessed the unsatisfactory situation and a second check-in agent duly arrived but it was a close-run thing for many passengers and we were 20 minutes late pushing back. Once on board the experience was good and I can again recommend the Happy Snack Plus offering which is good value and quality at EUR6.50. Return flight was fine albeit 40 minues late - excellent self-check-in arrangement at CGN.\n",

      "STN-CGN-STN first time with Germanwings. Some confusion when booking as the website kept reverting into German and it wasn't later possible to verify my booking online (so I phoned and everything was quickly confirmed). Outward was no problem at all. Allocated seating stops the stupid free-for- all crush and instantly makes the whole thing better than Ryanair. Coming back we arrived quite early and were told that the plane had been substituted for a smaller aircraft hence they were looking for people to bump onto the Lufthansa LHR flight. That'd probably be better for some people but we specifically needed to get back to STN. Fortunately they got enough people to change and we got checked through OK. However no-one told most passengers that their seat reservations were no longer valid (it was a completely different seat layout!) and so there was some frustration on boarding. But overall the service was good and the flights were on-time. We'll give them another try.\n",

However trip back this second time was diabolical. Flight cancelled. No explanation. Lousy ground staff at Cologne. Bussed to Dusseldorf with 60 other passengers for Air Berlin. Arrived too late - no GermanWings staff around; Air Berlin refused to take responsibility. Passengers getting very angry; police starting to take an interest.
